  <h1>JavaScript Basic Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Challenge 13</h2>
  <p>For this challenge handle the situation that happens if the user clicks cancel on the prompt, or does not enter text in the prompt.  
    <br> If the user does one of those two actions, have the hello() function log to the console "You didn't give me your name". Otherwise, have the console log the greeting.
    <br> hint: What do you get if, in challenge 12, you click cancel or put no text in the prompt?
  </p>
  

<script>
  
  let userName = prompt("Please enter your name", "")

  function hello(name) {
    if (name === "" || name === null) {
      console.log("You didn't give me a name")
    }
    else {
      console.log(`Hello ${name}, and welcome!`);
    }
    
  }

  hello(userName);
