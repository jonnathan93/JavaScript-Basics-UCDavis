  <h2>Challenge 4</h2>
  <p>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge4.html
    <br>  In JavaScript, prompt() can be used like this: var name = prompt("what's your name?", "Bob"); When the page loads a prompt will appear and the user can add some text. "Bob" is the default text. If you don't want default text, you can leave the second set of quotes empty.
    <br> Write  script that prompts the user for their name, and then display a sentence in the console that greets the user by name and welcomes them.</p>
  

<script>
  
  let name = prompt("what's your name?", "");

  console.log(`Welcome to my website ${name}`);

</script>
