  <h1>JavaScript Basic Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Challenge 6</h2>
  <p>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge6.html 
    <br> Notice in challenge 5, if a user types something other than a number, the console tells us they entered a big number. In this challenge, fix that so that if a user types something other than a number, the console displays a message that says there was an error.

<script>
  
  let number = prompt("please enter a number", "");
  
  if (number < 10) {
    console.log("You entered a number smaller than 10");
  } 
  else if (number > 9) {
    console.log("you entered a big number")
  }
  else {
    console.log("ERROR: you didn't enter a number!")
  }


</script>
